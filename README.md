Get sharp and stay sharp with more than fifty practice exercises rooted in real-world scenarios. If you’re a new programmer, these challenges will help you learn what you need to break into the field, and if you’re a seasoned pro, you can use these exercises to learn that hot new language for your next gig.
## About this repo:
- We found that the "57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills" is an interesting book for learning new languages using the most effective method: practice.
- Unfortunately most new programmers needs answers to the problems that are trying solve while practicing.
- And because this book is language agnostic the author didn't provide solution to his exercices.
- Therefore we the developers of BraveDroid company decided to share with this repositroy as one of many possible solutions using Java8 and Kotlin as programming languages.
